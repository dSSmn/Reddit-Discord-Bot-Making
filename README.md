# Discord Bots for Reddit
---

This is a repository for making Discord bots for Reddit.

These bots will usually follow the same install process, see below.

If I have made a bot for you, it can be found by entering the folder with your Reddit username.

**Installation:**
- Download and install Python 3.6 or up.
- Download your bot(s) files.
- Navigate to the directory of your bot.
- Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Usage:**
- Navigate to the directory of the bot.
- Open `bot.py` and insert your bot's token with the placeholder.
- Run `python bot.py`
